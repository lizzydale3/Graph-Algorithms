### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

**Use Case**: BFS is ideal for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs and for level-order traversal.

**Approach**:
1. Initialize a queue and add the starting node.
2. Mark nodes as visited as you explore each node level by level.
3. Process each neighbor of the node and add unvisited neighbors to the queue.

**Edge Cases**:
- **Disconnected Graphs**: If the graph is not fully connected, ensure isolated nodes are handled.
- **Cycles**: Implement checks to avoid revisiting nodes.
